<section><h3>The Main Route Of Exposure Is Inhalation.</h3><br/><p>Web diethyl ether is simply called ether, but was once called sweet oil of vitriol. Used as an excellent solvent for alkaloids, dyes, fats, oils, resins and waxes. It has limited solubility in water (6.05 g/ (100 ml) at 25 °c [2]) and dissolves 1.5 g/ (100 g) (1.0 g/ (100 ml)) water at 25 °c.</p><h3>Web A Putative Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Is Believed To Metabolize Diethyl Ether.</h3><br/><p>It also finds application as an extraction solvent in chemical synthesis. Because of its characteristics diethyl ether was widely used in many countries as an anesthetic agent, but was then replaced by other substances in the 1960s. Used as a common laboratory solvent.</p><h3>(Organic Compound, Countable) A Compound Containing An Oxygen Atom Bonded To Two Hydrocarbon Groups.</h3><br/><p>Web the therapeutic efficacy of diethyl ether can be increased when used in combination with chloroform. The aromatic ethers include furans. Aliphatic ethers have no aryl groups directly attached to the ether oxygen.</p><h3>(Organic Compound, Uncountable) Diethyl Ether (C 4 H 10 O), A Compound Used As An Early Anaesthetic.</h3><br/><p>It is an excellent inert medium for many organic reactions such as the wurtz reaction, grignard reaction, etc. It is used as a solvent for extracting organic compounds from their aqueous solution. Its molecular structure consists of two ethyl groups linked through an oxygen atom, as in c2h5oc2h5.</p><h3>Web A Potentially Major Use Of Dimethyl Ether Is As Substitute For Propane In Lpg Used As Fuel In Household And Industry.</h3><br/><p>Its origins may be traced back to 1540, when valerius cordus, a prussian botanist, first produced it. Used in the recovery of acetic acid from aqueous solutions in cellulose acetate and plastic industry. Ether was applied topically, inhaled, and consumed for medical purposes well before it was used as an anesthetic.</p></section><section><aside><img title="Diethyl Ether (C2H5)2O / Ethoxyethane AR Grade with Stabiliser Amertek" alt="Diethyl Ether (C2H5)2O / Ethoxyethane AR Grade with Stabiliser Amertek" rel="nofollow" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.amertek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/diethyl_ether.jpg" rel="nofollow"width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><small><i>Images: pinterest.com</i></small><p>It is an excellent inert medium for many organic reactions such as the wurtz reaction, grignard reaction, etc. The aromatic ethers include furans.

A code is a system of symbols, letters, words, or signals that are used instead of ordinary words and numbers to send messages or store information. Web cryptography, or cryptology, is the practice and study of hiding information.</p><h3>Web Cryptography Is Therefore Regarded As The Essential Component For Protecting Shared Information.</h3><br/><p>Symmetrical cryptography uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. Cryptography uses codes to protect data and communications so only the intended receivers can decode and understand them.

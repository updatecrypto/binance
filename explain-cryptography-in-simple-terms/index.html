<section><h3>Below Are The Description Of.</h3><br/><p>Cryptography is classified into symmetric cryptography and asymmetric cryptography. Web cryptography (from the greek kryptós and gráphein, “to write”) was originally the study of the principles and techniques by which information could be concealed in ciphers and later revealed by legitimate users employing the secret key. The enciphering and deciphering of messages in secret code or cipher.</p><h3>Web Cryptography Is A Form Of Securing Digital Data And Messages Often Using Special Keys That Only The Sender And Recipient Have Access To.</h3><br/><p>Cryptology is defined as knowledge of secrecy. converting. Thus preventing unauthorized access to information. Web cryptology refers to the study of codes, which involves both writing (cryptography) and solving (cryptanalysis) them.</p><h3>Web Cryptography, As Defined In The Introduction To This Article, Is The Science Of Transforming Information Into A Form That Is Impossible Or Infeasible To Duplicate Or Undo Without Knowledge Of A Secret Key.</h3><br/><p>Below is a classification of the crypto terminologies and their various types.

Cryptosystems use a set of procedures known as cryptographic algorithms, or ciphers, to encrypt and decrypt messages to secure communications among computer systems, devices and applications.

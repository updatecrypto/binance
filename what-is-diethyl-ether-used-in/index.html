Web uses of diethyl ether. Web diethyl ether is an ether in which the oxygen atom is linked to two ethyl groups.</p><h3>Chebi Diethyl Ether Is A Natural Product Found In Acca Sellowiana And Basella Alba With Data Available.</h3><br/><p>For this reason ethers frequently are employed as inert solvents in organic synthesis. Diethyl ether is probably the most commonly employed solvent for. It is an excellent inert medium for many organic reactions such as the wurtz reaction, grignard reaction, etc.</p><h3>Web Laboratory Safety Guideline Revised:</h3><br/><p>It is sparingly soluble in water (6.9 g/100 ml).
